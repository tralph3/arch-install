# Arch Linux installation script

This is my personal Arch installation script. Feel free to borrow it
as a base for your own script if you want, but I take no
responsibility for any damages or data loss that might incur with its
usage. There's plenty of hard-coded stuff in the installer that will
not suit everyone, so a fair bit of modification is in order.
